# DLaxV Community Projects Hub

The [DLaxV](https://dlaxv.de/) (Deutscher Lacrosse Verband/German Lacrosse Assoziation) proudly presents the Community Projects Hub. We know the great community of lacrosse has always consisted of active people who are makers with a talent for helping themselves and just build what the team needs. The idea of having a place to gather information about projects having their roots in this communtiy to spread them came up as we started our Shot Clock Initiative in 2020. Back then we thought about where to put all the information, instructions and insides of our two shot clock projects ([Shot Clock Web App](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/shotclock-web-client/wiki/Shot-Clock-Web-App-Wiki) / [Open Shot Clock](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/Open-Shot-Clock) ). We found Github and its many features for sharing open source products and just started working on them. Now we are happy to be ready to share the first releases with you. This also is the kick off for our hub. Following our DLaxV vision of minimzing barriers and growing the game we want to make this place first choice of DIY and community enabling lacrosse related ideas. But we need you to bring up your ideas and make our vision come true.

## How to Contribute

You want to programm an app or a website for making a lacrossers live easier? You have build something usefull for your team and want to share how you made it? Or you have an idea and need help to get started. Maybe you are an expert in stringing or how to set up a stick and want to share your knowledge? Just get in touch by sending an email to github@dlaxv.de and shortly explain your idea. We then figure out how to help you.
