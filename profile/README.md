# DLaxV Community Projects Hub

Hereby, [DLaxV](https://dlaxv.de/) proudly presents the Community Projects Hub to you. As we started a project called Shot Clock Initiative back in 2020, we needed to find a place to collect and share all the information, instructions, and insights we gathered. Github seemed like the perfect platform to do so and we are happy to share our first releases of the [Shot Clock Web App](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/shotclock-web-client/wiki/Shot-Clock-Web-App-Wiki) and [Open Shot Clock](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/Open-Shot-Clock) with you. But more importantly, we want to introduce the Hub as a new platform for Germany lacrosse to share it’s wonderful and creative ideas with each other. We all know how innovative the lacrosse community can be from building their own [portable goals](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable) to creating a [map](https://www.dlaxn.de/wall-ball-spots/) (by [DLAXN](https://www.dlaxn.de/)) to share wall ball spots with each other. Following our DLaxV vision of minimizing barriers and growing the game we want to make this platform your first choice for DIY and lacrosse related ideas enabled by our community. Of course, for this we need you to contribute your ideas and make our vision come true.


## How to Contribute

You want to program an app or a website to make the lives of many lacrosse players easier? You built something useful for your team and want to share how you created it? Or you have a revolutionary idea and need help to get started? Maybe you are an expert in stringing or how to set up a stick and want to share your knowledge? Just get in touch with us by sending an email to github@dlaxv.de with a short explanation of your idea or vision. We then figure out how to help you. For example, we give you access as an organization member to start a repository or we can simply upload content for you. In the end, we want to help you to make your idea reality. Grow the game!

## Contents

Below you can find all the Hub´s repositories. A repository is like a folder containing all information e.g., code, drawings, instruction, manuals etc. relating to one topic. If your topic consists of more than one part as the Shot Clock Web App does - with a [client](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/shotclock-web-client) and a [server](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/shotclock-web-server) environment - you can split your content in separated repositories. For sharing on top or background information you can use the wiki feature of Github as it was done for the Open Shot Clock Wiki.
